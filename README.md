An introduction to Git using BlueJ!

Git allows version control of whatever you check in. 
It is especially useful for code repositories because it makes it easier to share code, review code, save code, and (probably) most importantly, revert code.

One can version control anything! 

While you can use Git in the command line, I feel like using an IDE is more approachable and easier to visualize what is happening. 
Either approach is acceptable, and (most) anything you can do in the command line, you can do in an IDE.
